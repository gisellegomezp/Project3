to sit on my truck s back seat too tall for my truck bed with tonneau cover of course i needed to test it as soon as it was delivered i started running into issues none of my faucets would accept the cheap flimsy and i mean flimsy input hose anyways i wouldn t want dirty wash water draining into my kitchen sink yucky so i positioned it in front of my laundry sink used a bucket to add water to the wash side and draped the drain hose on the edge of the laundry sink my husband was confused why i have a brand new speed queen washer and ordered this one i m ready to rock n roll so excited over a new machine that feeling was soon to pass at odds with some reviewers water can be added to the top of the lint compartment as per the instructions my first load consisted of two pairs of scrubs pillow case and some lingerie in a mesh bag in the future all clothing will be separated and put into mesh bags the machine washed well but the clothing ended up being roped and the ties from the scrub pants untied so everything was tied together spin and rinse time i wanted to try some of the suggestions other reviewers posted but i was limited by the use of the bucket i ve read and viewed everything i could find re this machine to be able to wash a load while using the spinner with the hose attached to the spin side input port for a spray rinse seemed like a good idea since i didn t have that option i drained the wash water put the dial back to wash i was going to fill again for rinsing transferred half the load to the spinner set the spin timer and yahoo it was working then i realized the extracted water had to go somewhere i had to move the dial from wash back to drain it started draining from the spinner okay there goes that option of using both sides at the same time if i had a second load to wash using the same soapy water if usable was a no go some reviewers posted taking the sopping wet clothes and transferring to a tub or another container in order to do more than one load using the same water then draining fill for rinsing clothes transferring clothes to spin while draining both sides fill again for second rinse finally spinning while draining both sides whew i need to plan on doing only one load daily my final pet peeve much water left in hose and machine after it s pumped all it can pump i knew by the weight of the hose and when i moved the machine what to do i can t risk setting it on my truck seat so i raised then lowered the drain hose several times but even though i managed to drain the hose good thing i had that drain pan there is still water in the machine from what i read i m going to have to elevate the whole darn thing with the hose dangling into a drain receptacle this isn t going to be as easy as i thought br i m storing it in my powder room with the lids up i sure hope it s not mistaken for a potty br br update nothing i have attempted will completely drain this washer spinner but i am now checking how many queen size sheets it will handle looks like one with two pillow cases to wash the other sheet and pillow cases i m going to have to transfer the soppy soapy sheet cases into the spinner in order to use the same water after washing those drain while spinning first load transfer second load and spin turn dial to wash to fill with rinse water etc don t say i didn t warn you all it s not as easy as stated it s very time consuming i should have purchased the completely automatic br br nd update same day several hours later finally the two queen sheets and cases two separate loads are ready for spinning i put the first load in the spinner closed the lids set the dial from wash to drain set the timer on the spin side and waited made sure all lids were closed power on of course it was as the pump was running waited nothing happened with the spinner i kept opening and shutting the lids turning off and on everything but kicking it it apparently decided since it was me that it wasn t going to spin after one time long story short transfered wet sheets to main washer for rinse spin e mailed seller for pre paid return label contacted pay pal to alert them did my best to drain water had to pick the blasted thing up to put on chair to elevate to no avail as water is still sloshing inside and to make my day hurt my back lifting the thing buyer beware br br rd and final update seller ezbyonline com after several calls e mails sent me a pre paid return shipping label i arranged for pick up the next day this defective unit still sloshing with water is on it s way back to the seller and best of all my refund was posted the next day i believe this is deemed good customer service',\n",
