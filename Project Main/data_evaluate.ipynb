the fifth star for when i can accurately test this with a keurig let me explain my husband and i used a keurig for many many years when our second one pooped out we bought a similar type brewer i think its a cuisinart that brews a whole pot of coffee on one side as a regular drip not using k cup pods or anything and on the other side you could switch between a k cup pod or a larger individual mug that brewed as a drip brewer but with a smaller filter we used this for a bit and then when we moved overseas we packed it up and put it in storage we are now back in the states but in a much smaller home than previously so we didn t want to take up valuable counter space with the brewer we have since been using the drip filters that came with the machine for our individual cups of coffee each morning and we have lent our brewer to a friend to be used as a k cup brewer all this is to say that we have been using reusable drip coffee filters in our cups each day to brew coffee it is an imperfect method as my husband uses an oversized mug for his double cup of coffee and the filter sits at the bottom of the cup making it to where we pour the boiling water from a kettle all the way to the very top of the filter resulting in some grinds overflowing into his cup i use a smaller filter that does a nice job of resting on the smaller mug but also runs into the overfilling problem if you can imagine the filter sitting on the mug like this product but rather than the filter continuing up above the mug the top is level with the top of the mug br at any rate i saw these filters available at a discount for an honest review and i was super excited although i didn t plan on using them with a keurig i thought they would be perfect to deal with our overflow problem while being really small and compact taking up very little space in our small kitchen and they just look so sharp they come packaged well in their own little box each piece was wrapped in their own plastic in order to avoid any rubbing between them or breakage they came conveniently stacked which is how i keep them on our counter now there was no damage to any of the pieces there are three pieces as the description states one that sits on a regular sized mug half in the mug and half still above the mug the other one would be used for something larger where it sits all the way down into the container and the third piece is a handy tray to set them on i actually really like having the tray as i find myself looking for somewhere to place my used filter when i have just removed it from my mug i have become used to setting it directly in the sink but sometimes it is filled with dishes and i don t want to set it on the counter and have a big mess so this little coaster is nice as it collects any remaining liquid that runs out of the used filter and has a small handle to easily move it around br i used the one that sits on the individual mug the one in the main picture for this product the next morning for my coffee i set it on the mug as i am waiting for my kettle to boil the water and fill with a tablespoon of grinds with the drip filters we usually use i pour the boiling water directly over the grinds until the mug is full to the top the water goes directly into the grinds and through them as fast as i can pour the water which means that once the mug is filled with water i lift up the filter and set it in the sink my coffee is ready to drink in less than a minute when i tried this method with these filters it did not go so well i began pouring the water over the grinds and it immediately filled up the filter to the top and very very slowly dripped the coffee into the mug so slowly that i had to sit and wait for a good amount of time before i added anymore water which i had to do over and over again standing there watching it barely drip water through the grinds when i would fill it with water all the way to the top of the filter some of the coffee would come out of the filter that is above the mug and end up on the part that holds it on the rim of the mug the company accounted for this by making holes for the coffee to drain through but i still had to sort of pour it through the holes toward the end as i was slowly pouring water into the filter i realized that i was unable to determine when i should stop the filter as it is covering most of the top of the mug does not allow for my to see the level of coffee in the mug but also it is hard to guess how much water will end up coming through the grinds filter once i am done pouring and remove it from the mug all in all with some lifting and setting back down pouring more water lifting to check again setting it back down etc i was able to fill my mug albeit overfull but close enough that said once the mug was near full i still had to lift up the filter and hold it there as the water slowly poured out of the bottom half of the filter so this took much much longer to make than our regular cup of coffee despite it not having as many grinds in the coffee the coffee also ends up tasting different than it normally does but that is a whole other topic as we do a different sort of coffee preparation compared to the typical drip that you expect from a keurig i tried using the larger one on my husbands coffee after i used the smaller one on mine and ran into the same issues it took much too long for what we are used to so for our way of making coffee this product does not work very well that said i really love them and i really want to make them work for us so i may need to work on our patience a bit and or grind our beans a bit larger or smaller to experiment and see if i can work these out for us they are just so darn nice looking and compact i want to make them work also back to my holding out on the last star i intend on using these as they are intended at some point because i am really curious to see how they would work out br so i wrote all of this because i wanted to let people know that they do not work well for the way we used them but i want to say that i think they would work well how they were intended to be used the way the keurig works is that you can place your mug there go do something else and come back to a perfectly sized cup of coffee a couple of minutes later i can imagine that these would work very well for that my problem of being impatient and standing there with a kettle pouring water at a slow rate pretty much mimicked what a keurig does pours water at a slow and steady rate through a small pod of grinds to make a perfectly sized cup of coffee my problems of not knowing when to stop pouring water again would not be an issue if i were using this with a keurig as it only dispenses the appropriate amount and you do not have to watch for any levels or make sure you are compensating for the water still in the grinds and the way the coffee tastes a clean cup of coffee is more like what one would find from a regular drip brew that has spent more time in the grinds and has been filtered more than our other method which doesn t have some of the coffee components filtered out this is why i rated this stars despite it not working for our immediate needs i think it is a quality product that is really clean and serves a pretty great purpose br in fact i know that anyone can now buy reusable k cup pods and put their own coffee grounds in them i really think that this product is way better than that idea honestly i would buy this set up over the reusable pods now that i know this exists for one those little pods can be annoying to fill if you are not really careful with your pouring depending on how much you need coffee and how early it is this may be a real issue and oftentimes can end up with a mess of grounds on the counter secondly once filled if there was any spillage the grinds can cause the little pods to not close all the way making it so you have to take an extra step to wipe the edged of the container especially the area near the hinge and then try to close it again which sometimes closing them is a little more difficult that it should be i m not saying its a struggle i m just saying that you definitely need to make sure you get a good seal lest you find a mug and counter full of coffee grinds lastly opening and cleaning those reusable pods can be tough i do not have useable fingernail they are weak and so i would need to use a butter knife to open it prior to cleaning it the pods are small and that can make it tough to get all grinds out of as well this product bypasses all of those issues the opening where you pour in your grinds is large and wide causing no spillage there is no lid to snap on so no need to wipe the edges or struggle with a jammed lid and its super easy to clean also if you only have one reusable k cup and a couple of people who desire coffee it can sure take a lot of the convenience out of the keurig when you have to fill it wipe the edges snap it closed brew the cup pry the lid open with a butterknife try to clean it out as best you can and refill it including carefully pouring wiping the edge and snapping the lid to make another cup or more in this case you easily pour the grinds in the top set it below the keurig let it brew dump the grinds rinse the filter it all comes out with a second rinse in the sink easily pour more grinds in and brew again this is a guess but i am sure one could make at least twice the cups of coffee using this product compared to having to repeat all of the steps with a reusable k cup pod oh and the only thing that may persuade me to pass this product on to my mother is that she had her old keurig die on her and they no longer make that model so she had to get a the new vue one well this new design has a completely sifferent type of kcup rendering all of her single use k cups useless as well as her set of reusable k cup pods ridiculous however if she had this she could go through a million different keurig like brewers and never have to change a thing as it is now she had to buy all new reusable k cup pods and she has to cut open her single use pods dump the grinds into the reusable one and throw away the unused single use pod its really annoying i may end up buying one of these sets for her rather than giving away ours i really do like these and we may get our brewer or another one like it back in the near future and i would be excited to use these in the meantime i will try to remember to bring them to my mother s or friend s house to use it with their keurigs so i can add that last star that i think this product deserves br so last words are that i think this is an awesome filter set that anyone with a k cup brewer should get even if you hardly ever use your own ground coffee because you never know when you may want to pick up those freshly roasted beans grind them yourself and have an amazing cup of fresh coffee all with the convenience of your k cup brewer br one last thing i ended up contacting the company regarding the discount i used and they got back to me incredibly fast and the coupon ended up being for even more than originally described they were really helpful and friendly and i wouldn t hesitate to contact them if you need to br one last last thing that i forgot to mention sorry i tried using these with loose leaf tea and they worked fantastically i remember now that i can not give these away because i love loose leaf tea and these worked so well they did not allow any of the tea leaves even powdery bits into the cup of tea unlike when i poured the water over the coffee the water ran straight through the filter and made it easy to see where the fill line was i was able to fill my mug up to the top with water and let the leaves steep for awhile as i lifted the filter up the water poured out just as fast making it quick to set in the little coaster thing and start enjoying my tea so even if you do not drink coffee or use a keurig at all this is still a fantastic way to make tea nice clean cup without using all the paper filters with tags etc and easy to rinse clean',\n",
